1. What is a Convolution?

- [X] A technique to isolate features in images
- [ ] A technique to make images smaller
- [ ] A technique to filter out unwanted images
- [ ] A technique to make images bigger

2. What is a Pooling?

- [ ] A technique to make images sharper
- [ ] A technique to isolate features in images
- [X] A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features
- [ ] A technique to combine pictures

3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

- [X] They isolate features in images
- [ ] They make processing of images faster
- [ ] They make the image smaller
- [ ] They make the image clearer

4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?

- [ ] 31x31
- [ ] 25x25
- [ ] 28x28
- [X] 26x26

5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?

- [X] 13x13
- [ ] 26x26
- [ ] 56x56
- [ ] 28x28

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

- [ ] Faster
- [ ] Stay the same
- [ ] Slower
- [X] It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
